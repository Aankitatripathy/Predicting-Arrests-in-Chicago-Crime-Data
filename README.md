Crime prediction and prevention are critical for ensuring public safety and effective police administration. Chicago, one of the largest cities in the United States, these challenges are particularly complex due to the city’s diverse socio-economic landscape and varying crime rates across neighbourhood. By leveraging historical crime data, it becomes possible to predict certain outcomes, such as the likelihood of arrests in reported crime incidents. This capability is invaluable for enhancing policing strategies and shaping policies. Analysing and predicting arrests based on historical crime records from Chicago data that includes details such as crime type, location,date, time, and arrest status can be effectively approached using advanced statistical and machine learning methods. These techniques help uncover patterns and identify significant factors influencing arrests.

The target variable in this project utilizes the "Arrest" field to identify whether an arrest could be made for a given crime using the method of supervised learning. This objective is achieved by the use of models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, whose performances are evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
